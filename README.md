# Chuks Kitchen - Digital Restaurant Web Application

## Project Overview

This project is a **Food Ordering & Customer Management System** developed for **Mr. Chukwudi Okorie (Mr. Chuks)**, the owner of **Chuks Kitchen**, a Nigerian restaurant specializing in authentic local dishes. The project was developed by **TrueMinds Innovations Ltd** to digitize the food business, allowing customers to register, browse meals, place orders, and track activity online.

### What We Built

The web application consists of **5 main screens**:

1. **Landing Page (Hero Screen)** - The initial landing page with a hero section showcasing the restaurant's welcome message and call-to-action buttons
2. **Sign Up Page** - Registration form for new customers to create an account
3. **Log In Page** - Authentication page for existing customers to log into their accounts
4. **Home Page** - Main dashboard displaying popular food categories and chef's specials
5. **Orders Page** - Customer's order history and tracking interface

> **Note:** This is a frontend-only implementation. No backend, APIs, or authentication is implemented Stack Used.

| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **React 18**         | Frontend framework for building the user interface              |
| **Vite**             | Build tool for fast development and optimized production builds |
| **React Router DOM** | Client-side routing for navigation between pages                |
| **CSS3**             | Styling with custom properties (CSS variables)                  |
| **ESLint**           | Code linting for maintaining code quality                       |

### Why These Technologies?

- **React** was chosen for its component-based architecture, allowing reusable UI components
- **Vite** provides lightning-fast development server and optimized production builds
- **React Router** enables seamless client-side navigation without page reloads
- **CSS Variables** allow for consistent theming and easy color scheme modifications

## Design Interpretation

### Design Assumptions

Since this was implemented from a Figma design, the following assumptions were made:

1. **Color Scheme**: Used `--primary-orange` as the main brand color (#FF6B35 or similar), with dark text (#333333) for readability
2. **Typography**: Used clean sans-serif fonts for a modern look
3. **Layout**: Implemented responsive grid layouts for food categories and specials
4. **Navigation**:
   - Desktop: Horizontal link layout with logo on left, links centered, actions on right
   - Mobile: Hamburger menu slides in from the right

### Hamburger Menu Implementation

The main navbar includes a fully functional responsive hamburger menu:

- **Desktop (>768px)**: Horizontal navigation links with Login button visible
- **Mobile (≤768px)**:
  - Hamburger icon appears on the right side of the navbar
  - Clicking the hamburger slides in a menu from the right with smooth animation
  - All navigation links and Login button are accessible in the mobile menu
  - An overlay darkens the background when the menu is open
  - Menu closes automatically when a link is clicked
  - The hamburger icon animates into an "X" when the menu is open

### Animations & Transitions

- **Hamburger to X**: Smooth rotation transformation (0.3s ease)
- **Menu Slide-in**: Cubic-bezier transition for natural motion (0.4s)
- **Overlay Fade**: Semi-transparent backdrop that fades in/out
- **Link Hover**: Subtle padding and color transitions on hover

---

## Limitations & Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **No Backend** - All data is hardcoded/mocked; no real database connection
2. **No Authentication** - Login/Signup forms don't actually authenticate users
3. **No Cart Functionality** - "Add to cart" buttons don't persist data
4. **No API Integration** - All data is static/mocked within components
5. **Limited Form Validation** - Basic validation only

### Recommended Improvements

If given more time, the following improvements would enhance the application:

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to a RESTful API or GraphQL for real data
2. **Authentication System**: Implement JWT or OAuth for user authentication
3. **State Management**: Add Redux, Zustand, or Context API for global state (cart, user session)
4. **Persistent Cart**: Use localStorage or database to persist cart items
5. **Payment Integration**: Add payment gateway (Stripe, Paystack) for order processing
6. **Admin Dashboard**: Create an admin panel for managing menu items and orders
7. **Search Functionality**: Implement actual search across menu items
8. **Order Tracking**: Add real-time order status updates
9. **Image Optimization**: Implement lazy loading and image optimization
10. **Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels and improve keyboard navigation
